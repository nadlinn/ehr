## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical design and architecture for a high-performing, scalable, and modular full-stack application. The system is designed to capture patient data and transmit it to various Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems based on client-specific configurations. The primary technologies used are NestJS for the backend and Next.js for the frontend.

### 1.1. Problem Statement

The core challenge is to create a flexible system that can handle patient-provided data from a standardized questionnaire and map it to the correct API endpoints and data fields of different EHR systems. This mapping is unique for each EHR and must be manageable and scalable.

### 1.2. Requirements

- **Modular EHR Integration:** The system must allow for the addition of new EHR integrations with minimal code changes.
- **Dynamic Data Mapping:** A flexible data mapping mechanism is required to translate incoming data to the specific format of each target EHR.
- **Transactional Integrity:** All data transmissions to EHR systems must be atomic and verifiable to ensure data consistency.
- **Scalability and Performance:** The architecture must be designed to handle a growing number of users and EHR integrations without performance degradation.
- **Configuration Management:** Mappings for each EHR should be stored and managed in a way that is easy to update and retrieve.
- **Multi-language Support:** The system must support multiple languages (English/Spanish) for global accessibility.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** High-volume patient data processing must be handled asynchronously to maintain system responsiveness.
- **Bulk Operations:** The system must support bulk patient data transmission to multiple EHR systems simultaneously.
- **Caching Layer:** Frequently accessed data must be cached to improve performance and reduce database load.

## 2. System Architecture

A microservices-inspired, decoupled architecture. Backend is a NestJS application responsible for the core business logic, layered and modulized for large scale enterprise application. while frontend is a Next.js application providing the user interface, routing control. Shadcn UI components are used to avoid reinvent the wheel and better addaptive rendering experiences. Communication between the frontend and backend is via a RESTful API for now. ** gRPC/SSE for future enhancements

### 2.1. Backend Architecture (NestJS)

The backend is structured around a core API and a set of modular EHR integrations. This promotes separation of concerns and allows for independent development and deployment of EHR modules.

#### 2.1.1. Core API

The core API handles:
- User authentication and authorization.
- Patient data intake and validation with multi-language support.
- A generic data processing pipeline with caching and queue integration.
- Asynchronous and bulk processing capabilities.
- Multi-language validation and error messaging.

#### 2.1.2. EHR Integration Modules

Each EHR integration is a separate module within the NestJS application. This modular design is achieved using NestJS's module system. Each module will contain:

- **A `Strategy` class:** This class will implement a common `IEhrIntegration` interface, defining the contract for all EHR integrations. This is an application of the Strategy design pattern.
- **A `Mapping` service:** This service will be responsible for fetching and applying the specific data mappings for that EHR.
- **API client:** A client to communicate with the specific EHR's API.

```typescript
// Enhanced IEhrIntegration interface with new capabilities
export interface IEhrIntegration {
  sendData(patientData: any): Promise<any>;
  getEHRName(): string;
  mapData(patientData: any, mappingConfig: any): any;
}
```

### 2.2. Frontend Architecture (Next.js)

The frontend is built with Next.js and React. Used Shadcn for UI components to ensure a modern and consistent user experience.

- **Component-Based Design:** The UI will be built as a collection of reusable React components.
- **State Management:** React Context or Redux ToolKit is used to manage application state.
- **Data Fetching:** The frontend will use a library like `axios` or the built-in `fetch` API to communicate with the backend.

### 2.3. Enhanced Features Architecture

#### 2.3.1. Multi-language Support (i18n)

The system implements comprehensive internationalization support:

- **Translation Service:** Centralized translation management with support for English and Spanish.
- **Dynamic Language Detection:** Automatic language detection from request headers or explicit parameters.
- **Validation Messages:** All validation errors are translated to the user's preferred language.
- **Success Messages:** User feedback messages are localized for better user experience.
- **Field Labels:** Form field labels and UI elements are translated appropriately.

```typescript
// i18n Service Implementation
export class I18nService {
  translate(key: string, language: string = 'en', options?: any): string;
  getSupportedLanguages(): string[];
  isLanguageSupported(language: string): boolean;
}
```

#### 2.3.2. Caching Layer

High-performance caching system for improved scalability:

- **Redis Integration:** Redis-based caching for frequently accessed data.
- **EHR Mapping Cache:** Cached EHR mappings with 1-hour TTL for 10x faster retrieval.
- **Patient Data Cache:** Temporary caching of patient data with 30-minute TTL.
- **Transaction Status Cache:** Real-time transaction status caching with 5-minute TTL.
- **Cache Invalidation:** Automatic cache invalidation on data updates.

```typescript
// Cache Service Implementation
export class CacheService {
  async getEhrMapping(ehrName: string): Promise<any>;
  async setEhrMapping(ehrName: string, mapping: any, ttl?: number): Promise<void>;
  async invalidateEhrMapping(ehrName: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

#### 2.3.3. Message Queue System

Asynchronous processing for high-volume operations:

- **Bull Queue Integration:** Redis-based job queue for reliable asynchronous processing.
- **EHR Job Processing:** Dedicated queue processors for EHR data transmission.
- **Bulk Processing:** Support for processing multiple patient records simultaneously.
- **Retry Mechanisms:** Automatic retry with exponential backoff for failed jobs.
- **Queue Monitoring:** Real-time queue status and job tracking.

```typescript
// Queue Service Implementation
export class QueueService {
  async addEhrJob(data: EhrJobData): Promise<void>;
  async addBulkEhrJobs(jobs: EhrJobData[]): Promise<void>;
  async getQueueStatus(): Promise<any>;
  async getJobStatus(jobId: string): Promise<any>;
}
```

#### 2.3.4. Enhanced Processing Modes

The system supports multiple processing modes:

- **Synchronous Processing:** Immediate processing for real-time requirements.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Non-blocking processing for high-volume scenarios.
- **Bulk Processing:** Batch processing for multiple EHR transmissions.
- **Queue-based Processing:** Reliable processing with retry mechanisms.

## 3. Data Management

### 3.1. Database

PostgreSQL database (my favorite DB) is used to store:
- User and client information.
- Patient data submissions.
- Transaction logs for EHR data transmissions.
- EHR mapping configurations with JSON support.
- Multi-language translation data.

**Enhanced Features:**
- **pgVector Integration:** Added for future Vector DB/AI integration needs.
- **JSONB Support:** Native JSON support for flexible EHR mapping storage.
- **Transaction Logging:** Comprehensive audit trail for all EHR transmissions.
- **Multi-language Data:** Translation files stored in database for dynamic updates.

### 3.2. EHR Mapping Management

EHR mappings are stored in a flexible JSON format within the database. This allows for easy updates and retrieval without requiring code changes. A dedicated table stores these mappings, associated with each EHR integration.

**Enhanced Mapping Features:**
- **Cached Mappings:** Frequently accessed mappings are cached in Redis for 10x faster retrieval.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Mappings can be updated without system restart.
- **Version Control:** Mapping changes are tracked with timestamps and user information.
- **Validation:** Mapping configurations are validated before storage.
